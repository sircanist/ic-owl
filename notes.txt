Prio 2
> anonymous identity entailment is not working

Prio 1
Get secure weakening
Add entailment set set OWLAxiom
SnortSensor can be in resultset but HoneyPotSensor not
 > because removing the DataPropertyAssertion automatically makes the ontology not entailing the complex Assertion with
     SnortSensor and the DataPropertyAssertion (having one not matching in a conjunction is enough to not entail it)
1 justification for two possible entailments > where the other entailment is not possible anymore after conversion to ElDescription

ideen fuer loesung

problem:
- compliant solution x another compliant solution could entail secret information

1.
- create multiple edges (new) for each possible selection of weakening one
  - merge all possible paths into one > as a set of all sets which has no element which is more general then another element (possible conflict with anonymous individuals)
  > only works if all possible compliant solutions are considered! i.e. algorithm does not consider values could stay, but priories removing them beforehand (in EL.. constructor)

2.
- create a ruleset with only one element in the axiom as a singleton in an axiom set
  > entailment no longer possible as a blackbox

3.
- rewrite handling of multiple entailments to only one concept and verify concept after concept (with applied reduction(s))
  > entailment no longer possible as a blackbox
  > intensive

4.
- find another way (algorithm in paper to filter out concepts in sets which are seen anywhere in policy definition)



--- problem for 1 is
OWLDatasomeValuesFrom >>> check if EL!!!!
